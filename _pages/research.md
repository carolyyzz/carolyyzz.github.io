Research Interests
-------
My research interests focus on developing statistical tools for robust causal inference and data-driven decision-making in social and biomedical sciences. Specifically, I have been working on
* Policy learning in causal inference
* Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
* Transfer Learning and Federated Learning
