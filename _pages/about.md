Bio
======
I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Harvard University in 2025, where I was advised by [Prof. Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu). Prior to Harvard, I obtained a B.S. in Statistics from the Special Class for the Gifted Young, [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) in 2020. 

I am currently a data scientist at Netflix, focusing on applied research in causal inference and machine learning.
